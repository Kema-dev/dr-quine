# dr-quine

This project is about making an introduction  to [Kleene's recursion theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene's_recursion_theorem)

There are 3 different programs to code in C, each with a different approach. The goal is to make the program replicate itself in various ways. You can find the full requirements in the subject [here](/docs)
